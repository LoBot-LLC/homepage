## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** latest LTS (v22+ recommended)
- **Next.js** latest (currently v16.4.5)
- **PostgreSQL** database (local or managed like Neon, Supabase, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LoBot-LLC/homepage.git
cd homepage

# Install locked dependencies (reproducible builds)
npm ci
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | **Yes** | PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/app_db`) |

> **Note**: The database is required at runtime for persisted blog posts and the health endpoint. If unreachable, the blog gracefully falls back to seed posts. During CI/build, a placeholder URL is used because Next.js imports the database module during compilation but does not connect to it (all DB routes are `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`).

### Database Setup

The app uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. The database schema is managed via Drizzle Kit (`drizzle.config.json`). The blog tables (e.g., `blog_posts`) are created automatically on first use via the idempotent `ensureReady()` logic in `src/lib/blog.ts` — no manual migration step is required for basic local setup.

A local PostgreSQL instance is recommended for development; alternatively, use any managed PostgreSQL provider (Neon, Supabase, AWS RDS, etc.).

### Development

```bash
# Start development server with Turbopack
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the site.

### Production Build

```bash
# Type-check, lint, and build for production
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

All API routes are server-rendered (`force-dynamic`) and require a working `DATABASE_URL` at runtime.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/health` | `GET` | Health check — returns `{ ok: true }` if DB is reachable, `{ ok: false }` with 500 otherwise |
| `/api/blog` | `GET` | List all blog posts (newest first) |
| `/api/blog/[slug]` | `GET` | Get a single blog post by slug |

### Example Response

**GET /api/blog**
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "slug": "introducing-lobot-llc",
      "author": "LoBot LLC",
      "coverEmoji": "🚀",
      "publishedAt": "2026-10-28",
      "translations": {
        "en": { "title": "...", "excerpt": "...", "body": ["..."] },
        "es": { ... },
        "vi": { ... }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**GET /api/health**
```json
{ "ok": true }
```

## 📝 Blog

The blog is powered by a seeded editorial data pipeline (`src/lib/blog.ts`). Posts live in PostgreSQL (table `blog_posts`, auto-created on first use) and are kept in sync from the `SEED_POSTS` array — no manual migrations for editorial changes.

**Seeded articles** (newest first):

| Published | Slug | Topic |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------|
| 2026-11-13 | `how-cathay-cargo-terminal-powers-hkia-daily-logistics` | How Cathay Cargo Terminal powers the daily logistics of HKIA, the world’s busiest cargo airport — import/export flows, exception handling, live-animal care, and the HKIA Cargo Data Platform |
| 2026-11-07 | `how-operation-epic-fury-inspired-lobot-tecnoindicator` | How the 2026 Middle East conflict inspired LoBot TecnoIndicator |
| 2026-10-28 | `introducing-lobot-llc` | Company introduction |

**Article features** (all rendered by `src/components/pages/BlogContent.tsx`):

- **Cover image** — high-resolution image displayed at the top of the article (e.g. `cathay cargo terminal.jpg` for the HKIA logistics article), with a `coverEmoji` fallback.
- **Inline images** — body paragraphs can embed an image via the `__IMAGE__:/images/blog/<name>|<alt>|<caption>` marker.
- **IEEE-style references** — numbered citations such as `[1]`, `[2]` inside paragraphs are clickable and jump to the matching entry in the **References** section at the end of the article, where every reference links out to its source URL.
- **Localized references** — the reference labels follow IEEE conventions in each language (`[Online]. Available:` for English, `[En línea]. Disponible:` for Spanish, `[Trực tuyến]. Có tại:` for Vietnamese).
- **Metadata** — every article shows the author (`By LoBot LLC Team`), the publication date, and an automatic estimated reading time in all supported languages.

Every seeded post is fully translated into the **3 supported languages** (`en`, `es`, `vi`) — titles, excerpts, bodies, image alt/captions, and references.

## 🧪 Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all checks (CI pipeline)
npm run typecheck   # Generates route types + tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run build       # Production build
```

CI runs on every push/PR to `main` with Node.js `latest`, using `npm ci` for reproducible installs.
